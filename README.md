# Vacation-tracker
For web server I used Denver-web-server.

Steps to run "Vacation Tracker":

1. Go to the directory  
:\test\server\

2. Run server.js file with node js

3. You can login with these users 

	user: test1@mail.com
	pass: 1234

	user: test2@mail.com
	pass: 1234

P.S. Forgot password module works, but not included to the code
	forgotPass module here  
	:\test\server\send_email.js
